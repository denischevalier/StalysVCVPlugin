## Abstract

This Plugin will contain the modules that I am creating in my study of [cybernetics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) in music.

My goal is to create a [Turing-complete](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) set of instructions for VCV. I would also use it to teach my child about computing and programming :).

My dream is to one day port it to eurorack (but I'd need to learn electronics first ðŸ˜…).

## Modules

### VC Dual Neuron

![VC Dual Neuron](/vcdualneuron.png)

This module is heavily inspired by [Nonlinear Circuits](https://www.nonlinearcircuits.com/) [Double Neuron](https://github.com/mhetrick/nonlinearcircuits) module.

The module is divided in three parts. On the left are two VC Neurons circuits, and on the right the original Combiner circuit.

Each Neuron is comprised of three lanes: One input, that is multiplied (four-quadrant multiplier). After multiplication, a VC offset is applied. The three inputs are summed and run into a half-wave rectifier and comparator. The comparator's bipolar output is summed with the rectified signal. SENSE adds a positive DC signal to the mix, while RESPONSE affects the magnitude of the comparator's output.

The Combiner circuit consists of two lanes (with four-quadrant multiplication and vc offset), normalized to each Neuron's output. The output of the two lanes runs into several logic modules:

- A Difference Rectifier (DIFFRECT), which is another creative mixer: the two lanes are summed. Then the negative mix is substracted from the positive mix. If the result is positive, it goes out the DIFFRECT+ output, otherwise it goes out the DIFFRECT- output.
- A MAX circuit which outputs the max value out of the two lanes.
- A SUM output which adds the two lanes.
- A DIFF output which substracts the bottom lane from the top lane.
- A MIN circuit which outputs the min value out of the two lanes.

This might seem overwhelming, but just experiment: feed it with LFOs, envelopes, sequences, oscillators or even itself and watch the complex waveforms it generates. You can use just some parts of it and it becomes a mixer/ring-modulator/waveshapper/logic module.

### 8 Comparator

![8 Comparator](/comparator.png)

This module is what its name indicates: 8 VC comparators: It outputs a gate whenever the input signal is superior to the value signal (defaults to 0).

Plug two different LFOs to see complex rhythms emerge.

### 8 Multiplier

![8 Multiplier](/multiplier.png)

This module is 8 four quadrant multipliers or ring-modulators (with attenuversion of the Carrier). A 5V voltage is normaled to the Carrier input.

If no cable is plugged into an output, it is summed to the next outputs.

This module is based on [VCV Befaco AxB+C](https://github.com/VCVRack/Befaco) implementation.

### 8 Sum

![8 Sum](/sum.png)

This module is 8 three inputs unity mixer.

If no cable is plugged into an output, it is summed to the next outputs.
